# Sample Project Usind Blink Example

This example demonstrates how to blink a LED using GPIO or RMT for the addressable LED, i.e. [WS2812](http://www.world-semi.com/Certifications/WS2812B.html).


### Hardware Required

* A development board with ESP32/ESP32-S2/ESP32-S3/ESP32-C3 SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming

Some development boards use an addressable LED instead of a regular one. These development boards include:

| Board                | LED type             | Pin                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| ESP32-C3-DevKitC-1   | Addressable          | GPIO8                |
| ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1   | Addressable          | GPIO8                |
| ESP32-S2-DevKitM-1   | Addressable          | GPIO18               |
| ESP32-S2-Saola-1     | Addressable          | GPIO18               |
| ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1   | Addressable          | GPIO48               |

### Configure the Project

Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`). 

In the `Example Configuration` menu:

* Select the LED type in the `Blink LED type` option.
    * Use `GPIO` for regular LED blink.
    * Use `RMT` for addressable LED blink.
        * Use `RMT Channel` to select the RMT peripheral channel.
* Set the GPIO number used for the signal in the `Blink GPIO number` option.
* Set the blinking period in the `Blink period in ms` option.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

## Example Output

As you run the example, you will see the LED blinking, according to the previously defined period. For the addressable LED, you can also change the LED color by setting the `pStrip_a->set_pixel(pStrip_a, 0, 16, 16, 16);` (LED Strip, Pixel Number, Red, Green, Blue) with values from 0 to 255 in the `blink.c` file.


The pixel number indicates the pixel position in the LED strip. For a single LED, use 0.

## Troubleshooting

* If the LED isn't blinking, check the GPIO or the LED type selection in the `Example Configuration` menu.
